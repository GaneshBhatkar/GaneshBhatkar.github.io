  <h1>Research Proposal</h1>

  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p><strong>Design and Development of a Modular 3-Wheeled Urban Ground Robot with Swappable Mission Payloads Using ROS 2 and Edge-AI for Smart City Applications</strong></p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    With rapid advancements in smart city infrastructure—especially in Japan—there is an increasing need for adaptable urban robotic systems capable of efficiently performing diverse public service roles. This research proposes the design and development of a compact, modular 3-wheeled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) tailored for urban environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UGV will feature swappable mission payloads specialized for tasks such as surveillance, autonomous cleaning, tourism guidance, and security patrol. By leveraging ROS 2 for flexible and robust robotic control alongside Edge-AI platforms like NVIDIA Jetson for real-time perception and decision-making, this project aims to create a scalable and cost-effective robotic platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The development aligns closely with Japan’s smart city initiatives led by NEDO and MLIT. The outcome will be a functional, field-tested prototype demonstrating modularity, autonomy, and adaptability suitable for dynamic urban settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Modern urban environments in Japan face multiple challenges such as an aging population, labor shortages, increased tourism, and growing safety concerns. To address these issues, smart city initiatives are driving the integration of advanced technologies and automation into public services. However, most deployed urban robots are single purpose, requiring different platforms for surveillance, cleaning, or tourism assistance. This leads to higher operational costs and inefficiencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This research proposes the design and development of a compact, modular 3-wheeled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) optimized for urban mobility. The UGV will support swappable mission payloads, allowing it to perform a variety of civic tasks with a single adaptable platform. Its compact size ensures maneuverability in narrow urban spaces, while its modularity enables scalable deployment across different sectors. Leveraging ROS 2 will provide robust, flexible software architecture, and the integration of Edge-AI will enable real-time perception and decision-making without relying on cloud connectivity. This project aligns closely with Japan’s smart city goals and aims to contribute practical, cost-effective robotic solutions for future urban societies.
  </p>

  <h2>Literature Review</h2>
  <p>
    Recent studies have highlighted both the challenges and the potential of modular Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in urban environments. Aravantinos et al. (2023) emphasize the need for unified control systems and hot-swappable payload capabilities in modular UGVs to enable flexible mission adaptation. ROS 2, with its distributed and lifecycle-managed nodes, offers a promising middleware framework to support dynamic payload integration and modularity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Edge-AI technologies, as discussed by Alzubaidi et al. (2020), are crucial for enabling robots to operate with minimal latency and bandwidth constraints, which is especially important in densely populated urban areas. While Japan’s NEDO and MLIT projects have driven significant advancements in smart city robotics, their focus has largely been on task-specific robots, which limits scalability and flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Studies by Yamato et al. (2022) and Kanda et al. (2019) underline the importance of socially aware robots that can adapt to multiple roles within urban spaces. However, there remains a significant gap in the deployment of multi-role modular UGVs capable of switching seamlessly between various urban tasks. This research aims to address that gap by integrating modular hardware design with AI-driven autonomy to create a versatile urban robotic platform.
